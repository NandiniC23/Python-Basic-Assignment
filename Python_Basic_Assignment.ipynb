        "1. **What is Python, and why is it popular?**\n",
        "-  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for building software applications, websites, automation scripts, data analysis tools, artificial intelligence systems, and more. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Here are the key reasons -**\n",
        "\n",
        "-  -**Easy to Learn and Use**\n",
        "Simple syntax that reads almost like English.\n",
        "Great for beginners as well as professionals.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Used by Top Companies**\n",
        "Companies like Google, YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, and NASA use Python in various parts of their tech stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Cross-Platform**\n",
        "Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Versatile and Multi-Purpose Can be used for**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Web development (e.g. Django, Flask)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data analysis and visualization (e.g. Pandas, Matplotlib)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Machine learning and AI (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Automation and scripting\n",
        "\n",
        "  Game development and more\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "-  An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes your Python code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Python Interpreters:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  CPython – Default and most widely used Python interpreter (written in C)\n",
        "-  PyPy – Faster alternative with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation\n",
        "-  Jython – Runs Python code on the Java Virtual Machine\n",
        "-  IronPython – Integrates with .NET\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "-  Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language.\n",
        "They are used to define the structure, logic, and behavior of Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Common Pre-defined Keywords in Python:\n",
        " -  Control Flow\n",
        " -  Function and Class Definitions\n",
        " -  Boolean and None Value\n",
        " -  Logical Operators\n",
        " -  Exception Handling\n",
        " -  Importing and Modules\n",
        " -  Variable Scope\n",
        " -  Object-Oriented Programming\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "-  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.Keywords are reserved words with special meaning in Python's syntax.\n",
        "Using them as variable names would confuse the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "-  The reason lists are mutable and tuples are immutable in Python comes down to design choices made for usability, performance, and safety in different contexts. Let’s break this down:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lists Are Mutable**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Lists are designed to store sequences of items that may change over time—e.g., adding, removing, or updating elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use case: Ideal for dynamic data structures like queues, stacks, or growing collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technical behavior: Internally, lists allocate more space than needed to allow efficient appending without needing to copy data every time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tuples Are Immutable**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Tuples are designed for fixed collections of items, often of different types, and are used where immutability is important (e.g., as dictionary keys or set elements).\n",
        "\n",
        "Use case: Useful for data integrity, preventing accidental changes, and as return types for functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technical behavior: Since their contents never change, tuples can be stored and accessed more efficiently in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the mutability of lists vs. tuples isn't an arbitrary decision—it's a deliberate design that allows each type to serve different roles in Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n",
        "-  == and is are both comparison operators, but they check for very different things.\n",
        "\n",
        "| Operator | Checks for              | Example Result                      | Typical Use                         |\n",
        "| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n",
        "| `==`     | Equality (same content) | `True` if values match              | Comparing data                      |\n",
        "| `is`     | Identity (same object)  | `True` if both refer to same object | Checking for singletons like `None` |\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-  In Python, logical operators are used to combine Boolean expressions (expressions that evaluate to True or False). They’re essential for controlling program flow using conditions.\n",
        "There are three main logical operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Operator | Description                          | Example                  |\n",
        "| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n",
        "| `and`    | True if **both** conditions are true | `True and True` → `True` |\n",
        "| `or`     | True if **at least one** is true     | `True or False` → `True` |\n",
        "| `not`    | **Inverts** the truth value          | `not True` → `False`     |\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is type casting in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Type casting (also called type conversion) is the process of converting a value from one data type to another—for example, turning a string into an integer, or a float into an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python supports both:\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit type casting (automatic)\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit type casting (manual)\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Implicit Type Casting**\n",
        "\n",
        "Done automatically by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Happens when Python safely converts one type to another without your intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usually occurs in mixed-type expressions, like combining int and float.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Explicit Type Casting**\n",
        "\n",
        "Done manually by the programmer using type functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "You tell Python exactly how to convert one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Necessary when Python can't or won’t convert on its own.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**  \n",
        "\n",
        "-  Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of your program based on conditions. They allow your program to make decisions—just like how we make choices in real life:\n",
        "  \"If it's raining, take an umbrella. Otherwise, wear sunglasses.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **How does the elif statement work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-  The elif (short for \"else if\") statement is used in Python to check multiple conditions—one after the other—when the first if condition is False.\n",
        "\n",
        "It provides a way to chain multiple conditions, making your code more readable and efficient than writing multiple separate if statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python checks conditions top to bottom:\n",
        "\n",
        " If the first if condition is True, it runs that block and skips all others.\n",
        "\n",
        " If it's False, it checks each elif condition in order.\n",
        "\n",
        " The first elif that is True will run.\n",
        "\n",
        " If none are True, the else block runs (if present).\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. **What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n",
        " -   Both for and while loops are used for repeating code, but they are suited for different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        " for Loop – Use When You Know in Advance How Many Times to Loop\n",
        "Iterates over a sequence (like a list, string, or range).\n",
        "\n",
        " while Loop – Use When You Don’t Know How Many Times to Loop\n",
        "Repeats as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  **Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don’t know in advance how many times the loop will run—like when you're waiting for a user to enter valid input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example - Suppose you're building a simple login check where the program should keep asking for a password until the user gets it right.\n",
        "\n",
        "correct_password = \"python123\"\n",
        "\n",
        "user_input = \"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "while user_input != correct_password:\n",
        "    \n",
